### Summary of personal data and its processing

**A personal data register is formed whenever something that can be connected to an individual is permanently stored.**  
❗Almost every system stores something about the user at some level.  
❗Almost every system includes a personal data register.  

**When a person is in a register**  
🔒 they gain rights 👉 [Rights of the data subject (tietosuoja.fi)](https://tietosuoja.fi/en/rights-of-the-data-subject)  
🔒 and the data controller has obligations 👉 [Accountability (tietosuoja.fi)](https://tietosuoja.fi/en/accountability)

**The data subject has the right to be informed about the processing of their data 👉 [Right to information (tietosuoja.fi)](https://tietosuoja.fi/en/the-right-to-obtain-information-on-the-processing-of-personal-data)**

**The controller must provide information about the processing 👉 [Informing the data subject (tietosuoja.fi)](https://tietosuoja.fi/en/inform-data-subjects-about-processing)**  
☝️ This is often referred to as a *privacy policy* or *privacy notice*.

**In certain cases, the controller is also required to prepare 👉 [Record of processing activities (tietosuoja.fi)](https://tietosuoja.fi/en/record-of-processing-activities)**

☝️**The data subject (user) must always be informed of something**  
❓**Try this**: Ask an AI tool (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT) the following prompt: *Can you provide a sample privacy policy filled with fictitious values?*

## Data Subject's Consent

🎯 **Processing personal data always requires a legal 👉 [basis for processing (tietosuoja.fi)](https://tietosuoja.fi/en/when-is-the-processing-of-personal-data-permitted)**

🎯 **The data subject can give consent for the processing of their personal data 👉 [Data subject’s consent (tietosuoja.fi)](https://tietosuoja.fi/en/consent-of-the-data-subject)**

**Consent conditions:**  
❗Specific  
❗Informed  
❗Truly voluntary  
❗Unambiguous expression of will  

⚠️ **Check the terms special categories of personal data 👉 [explicit consent (tietosuoja.fi)](https://tietosuoja.fi/en/processing-of-special-categories-of-personal-data)**

### Relationship Between Privacy Policy and Consent (Source: ChatGPT)  
✔️ **Privacy Policy**: Provides transparency and ensures accountability.  
✔️ **Consent (if used)**: Must be documented and refer to processing activities described in the privacy policy.

---

### Differences Between Consent and Privacy Policy (Source: ChatGPT)

**Privacy Policy**  
✅ An informative document that explains how users’ personal data is processed.  
✅ Includes all GDPR-required information: controller details, legal basis for processing, purposes, retention periods, and data subject rights.  
☝️ **Does not require user approval**, but must be provided for transparency.

**Consent**  
✅ An active action where the user gives explicit permission to process their data for specific purposes, such as marketing.  
✅ Based on Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR.  
☝️ **Requires user’s clear and voluntary consent** (e.g., ticking a checkbox).

---

### Summary – Do I need one? (Source: ChatGPT)

**Privacy Policy**  
☝️ Yes, this is mandatory.

**Consent**  
⚠️ No, if the data is processed for service operation or security.  
☝️ Yes, if used for analytics, marketing, or other non-essential purposes.

❓**Try this**: Open your browser in Incognito mode and visit a website (e.g., Yle.fi). You should see a cookie notice. Explore where consent is requested. You should also have access to a privacy policy or notice. Review both.

## Contract

The GDPR specifies six legal bases for processing personal data:  
✖️ Data subject’s consent  
✖️ Contract

When the data subject is party to a contract, their data may be processed to fulfill that contract 👉 [Contract (tietosuoja.fi)](https://tietosuoja.fi/en/when-is-the-processing-of-personal-data-permitted#contract)

---

### Example Questions

**1. Is the data subject’s consent required if the service doesn’t work without registration? (Source: ChatGPT)**

No, consent is not needed if the service requires registration to function, because the basis for processing is not **consent**, but the **performance of a contract** (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)). Processing is necessary to provide the service to the user.

**Exceptions**

If the service includes additional purposes (e.g., marketing or analytics) not essential for the core service, then separate consent is required. The user must be able to use the service without being forced to accept these non-essential purposes.

---

**2. When registering, must the user explicitly accept the contract, or is registration alone sufficient? (Source: ChatGPT)**

Registration alone is not enough to form a contract under GDPR and contract law. The user must explicitly accept the terms of service or agreement, to demonstrate they knowingly consent to them.

---

**Principles for accepting the contract during registration**  
1. `Clear acceptance action`
    - The user must actively do something, such as:  
        - Tick a checkbox (`I accept the terms of service and privacy policy`).  
        - Click a button like "Register" or "Create account".  
    - This demonstrates informed consent to the terms.  
2. `Accessibility of terms and privacy policy`
    - The user must be able to review the terms and privacy policy before registering.  
    - Clear links should be provided on the registration form.  
3. `Documenting consent`
    - The system should log the acceptance (e.g., checkbox tick or button click), so it can be shown if needed.

---

**Why isn't registration alone sufficient?**  

📌 **Informed consent:** A contract is formed when the user understands what they are agreeing to. If there’s no explicit approval, the user may later claim ignorance.  
📌 **GDPR transparency requirement:** Registration alone doesn't fulfill the requirement to clearly inform the user about data processing.

---

### Summary

When a user registers, make sure that:
1. The user performs an active consent action (e.g., checkbox or button click).  
2. Terms and privacy policy are clearly accessible.  
3. Consent is documented in the system.

☝️ This ensures the service agreement is legally valid and compliant with both GDPR and contract law.

**`Privacy Policy`**  
🔎 Always create one.

**`Consent`**  
🔎 **Yes**, if using data for analytics, marketing, or other non-essential purposes.  
🔎 **Voluntary**. The service must also be usable without it.

**`Contract`**  
🔎 **Acceptance is required** to use the service.

❓**Try asking an AI tool (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT) the following prompts:**  
- I have a reservation system where a person stores their email address. What do I need to do from a GDPR perspective?  
- Can you provide a sample privacy policy?  
- Can you provide a sample terms of service?
